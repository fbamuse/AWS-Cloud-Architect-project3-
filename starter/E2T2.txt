Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

	- In both instances , process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet
	- on Web Service Instance, Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance
	- In both instances, process 'systemd-network' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet
	- Web Service Instance is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.
	- Web Service Instance is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
	- No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on Web Service Instance.


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
	- Place the web service instance on the private network, install the bastion server on the public subnet, and set the inbound rule that allows only ssh from the bastion server.
	- Strengthen password rules with restrictions on length, expiration date, and character requirements
	- Forbid SSH login with password
